        "In this notebook, data scientist Mr. Topp will explore, segment, and cluster the different neighborhoods in the city of Singapore. He will obtain relevant location values from a json file and use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in city and analyze the most common venue categories in each neighborhood. Then, he will use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters with an algorithm called K-means clustering. Then, he will use Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Singapore and their emerging clusters. Finally, he will use the insight to make a data-driven recommendation as to where would be the best location for Mr. Nattawat's restaurant in Singapore."
