He will scrape a list of candidate neighborhoods from Wikiepdia, extract their coordinates from arcGIS, and use Foursquare API to explore the different neighborhoods in the city of Singapore. Specifically, he will analyze the volume of customer traffic and the number of existing restaurants. Then, he will use this analysis to group the neighborhoods into clusters with K-means clustering algorithm. Also, he will use Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods and their clusters. Finally, he will make a data-driven recommendation as to where would be the best store location for Mr. Nattawat in Singapore."
